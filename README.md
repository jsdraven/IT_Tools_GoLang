## Overview
This project is designed to be self-hosted. Under **AGPL-3.0-or-later**, if you modify and run it as a network service, you must make the source code of your modified version available to users of that service. For organizations that cannot comply with AGPL terms, a separate commercial license is available from the maintainer.

## Quick start
```bash
task run
# this is shorthand for go run /cmd/server/main.go
# visit http://localhost:8080
```

## Requirements
* Go 1.24+
* Recommended: VS Code + Go extension (`gopls`, `dlv`, `gofumpt`, `staticcheck`)
* Git with SSH configured

## Security notes
Do not commit secrets (API keys, SSH keys, tokens).

Prefer owner-only permissions on private keys.

Run `govulncheck ./...` before pushing to identify known vulnerabilities.

## Development
**Status:** pre-alpha scaffolding.  
Local loop:
```bash
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
staticcheck ./...
go test ./...
govulncheck ./...
```
Tip (Windows/VS Code): set Format on Save and organize imports; prefer `gofumpt`.

## Development with go-task
